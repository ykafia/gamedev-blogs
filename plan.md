1. Introduction

   * defining art and comparing it to game dev

   * Explaining how literature, visual art and music can work together (explaining the art of making videos)

   * Explaining the art of making games (from "The floor is lava" to more complex board games)

   * Game engine/framework (gathering tools for making videos and games)

   * Conclusion

2. Stride Level 1 : A simple game

   * Components of a game (Game logic, UI, Renderer, Inputs)

   * ECS with entities, components and processors in Stride

   * A brief overview of how Stride's rendering works

   * Making a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe / Pong (using a github template) and recording the development (probably through youtube or twitch)

3. Stride Level 2 : SDSL, the powerful shading language

   * Shaders for newcomers

   * Explaining the shader pipeline of Stride (SDSL/SDFX)

   * Implementing a new Post Process

   * Creating a custom render feature.

   * Making a ray tracer in SDSL (just rendering a plane and spheres)

4. Stride Level 3 : Now what ?

   * How to use Unity tutorials for Stride

   * How to use research papers to implement new techniques (Example of the simple blur shader)

   * A message encouraging contributions to Stride's game engine

   * A list of projects and contributions made by users (TR.Stride, Physics constraints components, VVVV/Fuselab etc.)
